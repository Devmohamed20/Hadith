    <h1>The Pledge of Allegiance to Avoid Sins</h1>
    <p>
      Narrated 'Ubada bin As-Samit: who took part in the battle of Badr and was a Naqib (a person heading a group of six persons), on the night 
      of Al-'Aqaba pledge: Allah's Apostle said while a group of his companions were around him, "Swear allegiance to me for: I Not to join anything in 
      worship along with Allah. II Not to steal. III Not to commit illegal sexual intercourse. IV Not to kill your children. V Not to accuse an 
      innocent person (to spread such an accusation among people). VI Not to be disobedient (when ordered) to do good deed". The Prophet ﷺ added: "Whoever among you 
      fulfills his pledge will be rewarded by Allah. And whoever indulges in any one of them (except the ascription of partners to Allah) and gets the punishment in this 
      world, that punishment will be an expiation for that sin. And if one indulges in any of them, and Allah conceals his sin, it is up to Him to forgive or punish him (in the Hereafter)"'.
      Ubada bin As-Samit added: "So we swore allegiance for these".
